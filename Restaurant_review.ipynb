Since I always have a place in my heart for a good sandwich, I had to check it out. \\n\\nThe outdoor seating area is obviously quite popular, as suggested by the sign near the entrance suggesting that anyone who wants to sit indoors does not need to stand in queue. You can\\'t tell from the outside, but there is plenty of seating inside (though mostly for smaller parties) and the place has a somewhat pub-like feel. I took a seat at the bar, contemplated one of their many beers, and decided to ask for a suggestion from the bartender/server on what sandwich to try.\\n\\n\"Well, it depends on what you\\'re feeling like.\" And she was right, there is a type of sandwich for almost any type of appetite. Hearty meatloaf? The indulgent daily special of beer-battered, deep-fried mussels? Since I didn\\'t feel like spending the rest of my day fighting a food coma, I settled on the \"Blue Ginger\" sandwich (created by Ming Tsai) - a grilled yet perfectly rare (and it is RED inside) tuna steak that is brushed with a teriyaki glaze. The condiments (lettuce, tomato, avocado slices, wasabi mayo) were the right combination, but the wasabi mayo wasn\\'t strong enough to leave an impression or contrast. Overall, it was quite fresh, delicious, and well-seasoned...BUT (always a but w/ me, sorry that\\'s how I roll) I think that focaccia is not structurally appropriate to hold together this surprisingly girthy sandwich. The bread, while perfectly toasted, herbed, and not too oily, inevitably gets weighed down and soggy from the fillings...leaving you with more sandwich on your hands than in your mouth. I took took to eating the rest of this with a fork and knife, which sorta defeats the whole point of it being a sandwich, doncha think?\\n\\nIn my opinion, the Asian slaw served w/ the Blue Ginger was sort of an afterthought. Although it had a nice sesame flavor, there was a missing acidic component, and the square-cut napa cabbage just looked sloppy (a thin julienne would have been much more appetizing to the eye).\\n\\nAfter I was done with my sandwich and fully satisfied, I was already thinking of what I wanted to try the next time I am in town.. But one question lingered: if the concept is to get the best chefs in Boston to create the menu...then why are so many of the sandwiches made by the Parish Cafe chefs???'",

Since I always have a place in my heart for a good sandwich, I had to check it out. \\n\\nThe outdoor seating area is obviously quite popular, as suggested by the sign near the entrance suggesting that anyone who wants to sit indoors does not need to stand in queue. You can\\'t tell from the outside, but there is plenty of seating inside (though mostly for smaller parties) and the place has a somewhat pub-like feel. I took a seat at the bar, contemplated one of their many beers, and decided to ask for a suggestion from the bartender/server on what sandwich to try.\\n\\n\"Well, it depends on what you\\'re feeling like.\" And she was right, there is a type of sandwich for almost any type of appetite. Hearty meatloaf? The indulgent daily special of beer-battered, deep-fried mussels? Since I didn\\'t feel like spending the rest of my day fighting a food coma, I settled on the \"Blue Ginger\" sandwich (created by Ming Tsai) - a grilled yet perfectly rare (and it is RED inside) tuna steak that is brushed with a teriyaki glaze. The condiments (lettuce, tomato, avocado slices, wasabi mayo) were the right combination, but the wasabi mayo wasn\\'t strong enough to leave an impression or contrast. Overall, it was quite fresh, delicious, and well-seasoned...BUT (always a but w/ me, sorry that\\'s how I roll) I think that focaccia is not structurally appropriate to hold together this surprisingly girthy sandwich. The bread, while perfectly toasted, herbed, and not too oily, inevitably gets weighed down and soggy from the fillings...leaving you with more sandwich on your hands than in your mouth. I took took to eating the rest of this with a fork and knife, which sorta defeats the whole point of it being a sandwich, doncha think?\\n\\nIn my opinion, the Asian slaw served w/ the Blue Ginger was sort of an afterthought. Although it had a nice sesame flavor, there was a missing acidic component, and the square-cut napa cabbage just looked sloppy (a thin julienne would have been much more appetizing to the eye).\\n\\nAfter I was done with my sandwich and fully satisfied, I was already thinking of what I wanted to try the next time I am in town.. But one question lingered: if the concept is to get the best chefs in Boston to create the menu...then why are so many of the sandwiches made by the Parish Cafe chefs???'"
